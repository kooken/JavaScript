Task 4
You have an array with three types of brackets, like
[ ‘{‘, ‘)’, ‘(‘, ‘)’, ‘)’, ‘}, ‘[‘, ‘]’, ‘)’] .
The number of elements and the sequence can be different.
You need to find out if all the brackets are paired in the correct sequence
(opening and then closing). Also, brackets can be nested, but nevertheless,
if the sequence is observed, they are considered paired.
Example:
[ ‘)’, ‘{‘, ‘(’, ‘(‘, ‘)’, ‘)’, ‘}, ‘[‘, ‘]’, ‘(‘ ] - two do not have a pair (the sequence is broken)
[ ‘{‘, ‘(’, ‘(‘, ‘)’, ‘)’, ‘}, ‘[‘, ‘]’ ] - all have a pair
[ ‘{‘, ‘(’, ‘(‘, ‘)’, ‘)’, ‘}, ‘[‘, ‘[’, ‘)’ ] - three do not have a pair
